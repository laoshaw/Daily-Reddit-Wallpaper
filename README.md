# Daily Reddit Wallpaper (on startup)
This script changes your wallpaper to most upvoted image of the day on /r/wallpapers or from any other subreddit.


**Run it on startup for new wallpaper on every session.**

*Supported: Linux (GNOME, KDE, MATE), Windows and OS X*

Dependencies
=======
Make sure you have Python installed and PATH variable set.

Ubuntu
------
If you don't have ```pip ``` for Python:
```
sudo apt-get install python-pip
```

You will need modules ```requests``` and ```praw``` installed, which are in requirements.txt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows
------
Follow [this guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install  ```pip```  and configure PATH variable.
The rest is the same.

Using script
=======

Simply run:
```
python /home/silvio/Scripts/change_wallpaper_reddit.py 
./change_wallpaper_reddit.py --subreddit wallpapers --time new --nsfw
./change_wallpaper_reddit.py --subreddit earthporn --time new --nsfw
./change_wallpaper_reddit.py --time new --nsfw
```

If you wanna use other subreddit, include argument with the subreddit name:
```
python /home/silvio/Scripts/change_wallpaper_reddit.py --subreddit earthporn
```

If you don't want to change your wallpaper daily, you can use newest, hourly, weekly, monthly or yearly wallpaper too by adding one of the following arguments: ```new```, ```hour```, ```week```, ```month```, ```year``` to the script.

Example:
```
python /home/silvio/Scripts/change_wallpaper_reddit.py --time week 
```


Too enable NSFW images, add ```--nsfw```.
